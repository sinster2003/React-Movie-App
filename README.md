# React-Movie-App
A simple react movie app interface called MovieLand where the user will be able to search for their favourite movies along with the year of release, type and title.
An external api, Omdbapi from http://omdbapi.com is used.

To run the code locally on your machine:
(i) An API Key has to be created from http://omdbapi.com and stored as environment variable in a .env file as REACT_APP_API.
(ii) An API URL has to be created to fetch the data such as http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey] and stored in a .env file as REACT_APP_URL
